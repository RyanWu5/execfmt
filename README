execfmt
-------------------------------------------------------

Execfmt is a library for parsing ELF, PE, and Mach files.
Execfmt collects processor architecture information, and
parses code sections. Symbol support is currently limited
to ELF files.

When provided a readable object, it proceeds to parse,
checking the provided object with coherence to each file
type sequentially before giving up.
